KRYPTO data encoding and decoding the program for Windows!
KRYPTO 2.0/2006 Professional multi user copyright (starting from 2003) by Detlef Granzow

The program Krypto codes files of all kinds with the help of loaded or produced keys a file. As keys file can be used each type of file or also no keys file. Krypto uses repeated 256 bits (full bits) a coding purely been based on information of the keys file, which are the technically highest coding depth at all on computers possible are.
Krypto can be decoded neither by humans or computers, without suitable keys file or password unauthorized. Also the entrance to the program Krypto is protected by users name and user password in highest coding depth. Krypto belongs world-wide, to the safest data coding to programs at all. There is the time world-wide no safe data coding program as Krypto of which for the purchase is offered.
Krypto is absolutely safe before of unauthorized data decoding.

Why are 256 bits the technically highest coding depth at all on computers possible are ?

A computer knows only 256 different indications.
1 indication = 1 byte has 8 bits in binary the number system exactly.
1 bit knows only the switching status: on or out or 0 or 1 by the combination of these 8 bits results 256 bits.
The computation in addition: 2 switching status highly 8 bits = 256 bits these 256 bits
is addressed in decimally the number system from 0 to 255 = 256 bits.
Computers work however in in hexadecimals the number system.
There these 256 bits designated above are addressed from 00 to FF = 256 bits.
A byte cannot be thus under bits 0 or over bits 255.
Therefore 256 bits are the technically highest coding depth at all on computers
possible are.

Proof of the Krypto security !
Which would be, if one would try one of Krypto coded file unauthorized to decode.
A coded file with the length of 18033 indications has therefore according to computation, 256 bits highly 18033 indications = 6,184355814363201353319227173630ë+43427
file possibilities. Each file possibility has exactly 18033 indications byte.
Multiplied by the number of file possibilities then need results in the memory.
Those are then: 1,1152248840041161000440562362208e+43432 byte.
Those are then: 1,038634110245961789082788150963è+43423 Giga byte data quantity.
That is a number with 43424 places.
I can surely maintain as much memory place give it in the whole world not never.
And the head problem now is, which is now the correctly decoded file.
Who it does not know can only say there. That does not know so exactly !
They can code naturally naturally also still successively several times, even up to
the infinity.

By the way: Specialists from all world state publicly:
Data coding where the file key is just as long as the file which can be coded is absolutely safe before unauthorized data decoding.

Them is clearly unauthorized data a decoding of one of Krypto coded
file nevertheless probably now therefore is absolutely impossible, for all times and
each technology.

1.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KRYPTO 2.0/2006 Professional multi user has now an intelligent Krypto user administration!
Thus different persons cannot use however all their Krypto. This Krypto user administration works with produced coded files. Each of these files represents a Krypto user. These files are always 80 byte largely and are even with same Krypto user inputs always completely different. They are coded with 256 bits (full bits) password coding as well as later also still by coincidence. The user name and users the password must be long at least in each case 6 indications and maximally 50 indications. Around new Krypto users to put on must you only on the Krypto field doubleclick with left mouse button. It gives two sorts of Krypto to users. Only Krypto master user can put on new Krypto users.
Users name and users password and user file name are readably logging into a file of their choice for you. Only in these users LOG file users name and user password are gelogt. Passwords for data the coding to be used, are gelogt in principle in Krypto.
All information to this topic participates in order of Krypto.

Unauthorized decoding of these Krypto user files can be likewise absolutely excluded. In principle there are here 256 to the power of 80 possibilities. Krypto writes log files, this is for it meant if the user many files with different keys coded, and later no more white, which keys file to which coded file belonged. Krypto does not write logs files with the data decoding, since one does not have to know no more after the decoding, how was coded before. Only one log file can be used also for many codings. That is called Krypto attaches new data at already existing log file. Also with the keys file production with log files one works. The logs file can later code it, change or in addition, to destroy and delete, or even read. The logs file production is not disconnectible, since the use of the logs file for the user proved as nearly indispensable. In the log file are located only used file name with program identification and date and time. It has to do thus nothing with espionage, but is the Krypto users to only help its files again to decode after perhaps longer time. With the file name from the coded file will decode selected and as suggestion on storing in the program Krypto indicated. Thus they know it automatically around which for a file to decode want themselves act, if must be even before the decoding of the coded file. The only information at the beginning in the coded file starting from the second indication and is, which is not coded in the coded file, stands for the file name the originals file in the coded file. This was made intentionally by me so and represents no security risk.

2.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File password coding !
The original file it to code would like one queries and one reads in later. Their password is queried and processed internally in Krypto. The password length must have at least 6 indications. In addition, they can clean-copy over the intermediate file whole file of contents as password in the passwords inquiry. I recommend to use them however in
principle passwords with at least 12 indications. Out their password internally calculated keys file not on non removable disk one stores or paged out, but remains only with the work of KRYPTO in the main memory (RAM), as long as the internally calculated key file is used by KRYPTO. The coded file is produced and stored. Afterwards those to use file name in one of them produced or selected LOG file stored with program identification and date and time like it otherwise also in Krypto usual is.

File password decoding !
The coded file it to decode would like one queries and one reads in later. Their password is queried and processed internally in Krypto. Krypto does not know its password, i.e. if its password is wrong, then also the file decoding is wrong. Krypto now always indicates the correct file name the originals file to them as suggestion. After take over file of the name the original file the decoded file now one produces and one stores. This produced file is absolutely identically to the originals file times with Krypto was coded. No Logs data are produced and stored.

Auxiliary function with the file password coding !
If you enter input field SCH in the Krypto and afterwards to file to password to coding with the left mouse button click, then also the calculated password key file on the non removable disk to the later use as well as the coded file is stored. If you enter input field in the Krypto SCH-KRY and afterwards to file to password to coding with the
left mouse button click, then only the calculated password key file on non removable disk without coded file is stored. Afterwards the log file is stored.

Note: This password key files are to be used only with the file password decoding compatibly. They can use however this password key files also with the other coding
built into Krypto problem-free. The decoding produced then are however not compatible with the file password and decoding although it completely similarly function. If you enter input field VOSP in the Krypto and afterwards to file to password to coding with the left mouse button click, then without keys or password only with the internal key
in Krypto and by coincidence one codes. These used internal keys is responsible only for the auxiliary function VOSP and EOSP in that password and decoding and not for the supplementary product lines VOSP and EOSP or other functions in Krypto. VOSP and EOSP as additive function with the file password and decoding in Krypto are meant for direct data coding, and not to code from keys. To use it here recommended of me urgently the additive
function VOSP and EOSP with the file password and decoding only in exception cases. Because this coding can be decoded by each Krypto user immediately without keys or password if it entrance to Krypto has.

Auxiliary function with the file password decoding !
If you enter input field SCH in the Krypto and afterwards to file to password to decoding with the left mouse button click, then before the keys selected of them file, which was produced before with the file password coding, is used for the file decoding. Here no more password is then naturally needed. If you enter input field EOSP in the Krypto
and afterwards to file to password to decoding with the left mouse button click, then without keys or password only with the internal key in Krypto and by coincidence one decodes correctly. Naturally only the files with the additive function VOSP with the file password coding were before coded.

Thus the file password coding functions !
1. Coding: From its password password is computed internally a key file.
2. Coding: This key file with codings an algorithm of which only in Krypto is,
           by full bits coded.
3. Coding: Afterwards these keys file is also coded only a secret password file
           full bit contained internally in Krypto.
           This is not the password key file from the 1. Coding.
4. Coding: Afterwards the original file with the keys file full bit is coded.
5. Coding: Afterwards the coded file is coded still once, but this time by
           coincidence full bit. The coded file is stored only now.
           By the additional of coincidence coding in the file password coding is
           always  calculated even when same Krypto use completely different coded
           file. These data coding thus one is fivefold (256 bits) (full bits)
           completely successively differently coding procedures used coding with five.
           An unauthorized decode these coded files can be likewise absolutely
           excluded for all times and each technology.

3.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File coding !
The original file it to code would like one queries and one reads in later. The keys file it for coding the originals file will have selected queried and later read in. The coded file is produced and stored. Afterwards those are stored to use file name in one of them
produced or selected LOG file.

File decoding !
The coded file it to decode would like one queries and one reads in later. The keys file it for the decoding of the coded file will have selected queried and later read in. The decoded file is produced and stored. This produced file is absolutely identically to the originals file those was times coded. No LOGS data are produced and stored.

Thus the file password decoding functions !
1. Coding: Their read in key file is already already coded computed.
2. Coding: This key file with codings an algorithm of which only in Krypto is,
           by full bits decoded.
3. Coding: Afterwards these keys file is also decoded only a secret password file
           full bit contained internally in Krypto.
4. Coding: Afterwards the coded file is decoded still once, but this time by
           coincidence full bit.
5. Coding: Afterwards the original file with the keys file full bit is decoded.
           The decoded file is stored only now.
           
By the additional of coincidence coding in the coded file changes with decodes the order in relation to the coding, which is completely logical. First the keys file just from the existing key file or its password, then the coded file is decoded by coincidence (as functioned one does not betray), and then with the internally calculated keys file the coded file is correctly decoded. This can naturally only function if all parameters to be needed, is absolutely correct, otherwise there is already correctly useless data garbage when small changes. That is also the reason why it very difficult is as a program as Krypto at all to be programmed. They should actually recognize already here clearly, which is Krypto in the computer world somewhat completely special, and also in the future remains unbeatable. The reasons for it are obvious,because more highly than 256 bits
(full bits) nobody can code all the same on which computer. Nobody needs more security than Krypto inserted. Still higher repeated full bit a coding than Krypto has, only more computing time would now already need, and absolutely no more security would bring. The operation of Krypto is already very well and understandably designed of me. One has the operation about Krypto firstonce understood needs one at all no Krypto assistance more, although the Krypto is present assistance.

4.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key file producing !
Thus coincidence key file produced those exactly the length the originals file has those it thereby to code would like. Afterwards those are stored to use file name in one of
them produced or selected LOG file. The produced keys file and LOG file can be also still
repeatedly used. Krypto is fixed on no data format. It is thus only one suggestion, which stands the file ending (SCH) for key files and (KRY) for coded files, and (VOS) for again coded keys files and (LOGS) for log files.
Krypto cannot conflict therefore during correct operation actually with other programs.

5.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File destroying !
File destroy reads in the length of the file which can be destroyed. Produces coincidence data and overwrites the file thereby, which can be destroyed. They can overwrite the file which can be destroyed freely adjustable in Krypto with up to maximally 250 times physically on their non removable disk with coincidence data, before the file which can be destroyed is then entgueltig always destroyed. In addition they must only in (KRYPTO input field) a number from 1 to 250 enter, and then on to file destroying field click. If other values stand in (KRYPTO input field), and it click on file destroying, then the file which can be destroyed is only once overwritten and destroyed always finally. If one
would repair the file with special programs, destroyed with KRYPTO, then one could repair only the destroyed file overwritten with coincidence data, and this would be naturally always absolutely useless. And exactly the same it is to also be.

6.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Handy SMS service with Krypto !
With a small trick they can use Krypto also for Handy SMS coding.
After you coded, can their SMS file with Krypto them with an Hex editor the coded file look at and into the Handy to type or into the Handy transfer the Hex values (not the addresses) otherwise somehow and to send.
They can send thus all kinds away of data also over the Handy SMS service.

7.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krypto has still five further additive of programs and assistance a program !
This additive of programs input and one know doubleclick to the left mouse button in (KRYPTO input field) to be started by keyboard of instruction. Krypto by the way
indicates in (KRYPTO input field) with the work, on which Krypto straight works.

Instruction the input: ? or KRYPTO input field !
Assistance shows a window in that the formats of the Krypto additive of programs to be indicated and the auxiliary function with the file password and decoding. Small users an assistance for Krypto user.

Instruction the input: Z10500 produces coincidence key file with 10500
                       byte. They can select the byte value freely.
                       Thus the public keys files were produced.

Instruction the input: P10500:Peter produces password key file with 10500 byte and
                       the password Peter. This is stored coded as key file. They
                       can select the byte value freely. The password is likewise
                       freely selected by them and can be very long. They can copy
                       even in the password input field over the intermediate file
                       data purely as password, or a picture, or music or which them
                       to want.

Instruction the input: OP:Peter produces password key file with the length the
                       originals file it to code wants, and the password Peter. This
                       file is stored coded as key file. The password is freely
                       selected by them and can be very long. They can copy even in
                       the password input field over the intermediate file data purely
                       as password, or picture, or  music or which them to want.

Both the program: (P10500:Peter) and (OP:Peter) a mathematical procedure for the coding, which is used only in Krypto and a long internal password in Krypto, uses data. This
used internal long password of Krypto, is used only by the additive programs (P and OP).
Since password keys are produced here, by coincidence one does not code here.

Instruction the input: VOSP codes files of all kinds without keys and password.
                       This program uses a mathematical procedure of which only in
                       Krypto is used and an internal long password of Krypto. This
                       used internal long password is used only by the additive
                       programs VOSP and EOSP. The program VOSP is for it meant
                       around coded password key file still once to later code with
                       the internal password of Krypto, but as key file for Krypto.
                       There fore this program uses its own file ending (VOS) which
                       one can use, but does not have. The internal password of Krypto
                       more normally point only in connection with their before password
                       even selected used. However they can code also every other file
                       with VOSP, in this case can then  however each Krypto owner the                            coded file with Krypto EOSP  problem-free decode. They should
                       not thus actually do this from security reasons absolutely.
                       Because VOSP is actually to codes meant from keys and not for
                       direct data coding. Since with password key files one works
                       here, by coincidence one does not code here.

Instruction the input: EOSP decodes files with the program the VOSP was coded.
                       However the originals file name is not indicated in the
                       program Krypto with to decode. That is thereby to justify that
                       key files also for several file codings to be used can. Became
                       one however keys a file codes develops thereby a coded file
                       with the file ending (KRY). The file ending (KRY) is not keys
                       file, but a coded file. An internal password of Krypto, which
                       is used only by the additive programs VOSP and EOSP in
                       connection with its freely selected password is secretly, and
                       can by the customer is not changed, and is alike with all
                       Krypto versions.

The internal passwords of Krypto do not represent a risk to security, because one can destroy the used keys file after with password and VOSP. One finally knows the password and additive the program VOSP. In addition the actual coding only later takes place,
with the keys file later produced with VOSP. Thus here three-way key concerns a coding even, which functions always differently. The last coding be based again purely on information of the used keys file, and is absolutely safe thereby in addition now also
by coincidence one codes. On the basis the coded file it is not possible to recognize with which method was coded. The internal password of Krypto is used only in connection with their password with the coding with password by the additive program VOSP or EOSP. It is an additional coding level which one use can and should, but does not have necessarily. They can code also with coded produced password very surely key file with Krypto files. The password length can be very very long. Also here an unauthorized decoding can be absolutely excluded.

8.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Krypto registration !
Krypto must be registered each time only with the first program start. This is only
with the enclosed registration file possible. Registering Krypto goes very fast. They have thereby only one attempt. With the next program they have start however again an attempt. The registration file is fixed with the file ending (RRR). However they cannot change the file name of the registration file, the file ending (RRR). The registrations file may never change it, since them become invalid otherwise immediately. It is absolutely forbade Krypto copying and to other persons personally or over computers giving or otherwise somehow further. Only therefore Krypto has its own registration.
Illegal copy all Krypto versions is punishable and guaranteed by me criminally and privately is pursued. If they use for example a computer also by other persons are
used, they can leave the registration file on the Krypto CD, and when leaving the computer simply the Krypto CD carry forward to you to come back. Thus no other person
can use their Krypto. Thus will say in such a way, which registration file as a user password file for Krypto although in addition also only her Krypto user name and
Krypto user password would be sufficient.

9.Paragraph
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Knowledge over Krypto !
Krypto runs on Windows of enterprise of systems Windows 98, Windows 98SE, Windows ME, Windows NT4.0 (service luggage 5), Windows 2000, Windows 2000 pro, Windows XP Home, Windows XP pro Krypto is completely mouse operated, used in addition, keyboard inputs. Zero byte files are for Krypto no problem, but for very many other software in the
world. Krypto must be installed on non removable disk and needs less than 5MB non removable disks memory. The registration file is installed not on non removable disk,
can be copied however by CD on non removable disk. Krypto needs somewhat more than 10MB free main memory (RAM). Krypto works gradually in 3MB and 4MB of steps also quite fast. Therefore Krypto can process absolutely each file all the same which kind and size without thereby much work memory (RAM) to use. Therefore Krypto can be used even on
older PC computers. If one works on however very large files with KRYPTO, then one
should use a fast computer from time reasons. Krypto must have always simultaneous
access to straight used files, which query her with Krypto with the work. They can by
the way start and differently use Krypto also several times. Krypto is also much to recommend for data transmission in the Internet. However a case the used keys file
should not be transferred, it is it is coded with Krypto. Krypto can decode files also damaged nearly correctly, under the following conditions. If individual bytes are changed, Krypto decodes the remainder of the damaged file correctly, only the changed bytes wrongly. If however bytes are missing, only a correct decoding up to the point is possible, starting from where bytes are missing. Others coding programs cannot decode when small changes any longer correctly. KRYPTO programmed with the hardware:
(MSI 6590 KT4 Ultra) and Athlon XP. Kryptochef recommends the hardware of MSI and
Athlon processors.

Special reference to the person Detlef Granzow !
I, Detlef Granzow, which programs programmers of the software
(Krypto 2.0/2006 Professional multi user) computers already since it computer gives. Krypto is an original and not by other programs or humans or computers was cribbed from. Everything in the program used knowledge and the idea for Krypto exclusively comes from
Detlef Granzow. In all other respects my data security was times heavily hurt. That annoyed me very much and programmed therefore I Krypto, an absolutely safe software,
which I with much time expenditure and intelligence as well as knowledge and care mainly for me and the world create has. Probably only subject people and companies will
recognize the true value of this software. Krypto belongs world-wide to the safest data coding to programs at all, and the price for it is actually too cheap. On Krypto of me clearly more than 1 year one worked and constantly one improved. Krypto was developed before by me also on other computers and programming languages into the last years.

Thus to say, the way was the goal. It referred to it, no humans and/or computer and/or
all computers of the world, this coding not without suitable keys file to decode here again to be able. Also programmers or hackers, even if they know completely exactly like
Krypto were programmed, cannot decode one with Krypto coded file without suitable keys file. Also computers hardware manufacturer cannot do that. Also I the programmer von Krypto cannot do that. It cannot do anybody. Whom the coincidence generator appears as
too uncertain can therefore with Krypto, every other file, if it is large enough as key file uses. However, then to it, that as keys to used file must be even paid attention, than those the originals file is not smaller, which one would like to code, since she is not loaded otherwise from Krypto. I would like to here also still determine which I no better data coding program than Krypto in the world know, which is sold. If they however which better know, they nevertheless please absolutely send a E-Mail to me. They get an answer back, if I evaluated its information personally.

Order of Krypto by E-Mail:kryptochef@kryptochef.net
Clicking it on our homepage completely down on Krypto order by E-Mail. They can send
only a E-Mail, if they have a E-Mail address. From an Internet cafe out, proceeds then only directly with its p.o. box with its E-Mail the Provider. Send a E-Mail order, with indication of their name and their ship-to-address and most exact data of the order of
Krypto. They get then by E-Mail answer of us, their own customer a number and our bank connection data and calculation the amount which can be paid from them to. If it then
with the indication of its customers number, which by its order calculated calculation amount in euro to our account transferred, is booked about our account, and the
money, for it a Krypto software on CD is manufactured and delivered to it. We strive
with snap possible distribution of the software (Krypto 2.0/2006 Professional multi user) to it, even if we are now already overloaded. Their data are passed on absolutely not
on by us third. Recognized conditions with the purchase of the software
(Krypto 2.0/2006 Professional multi user). They bought the software Krypto of the programmer of the software Krypto Detlef Granzow, therefore thank you I, Detlef Granzow
me them for the purchase of the coding software Krypto.

The software Krypto delivered on CD. On that CD is Krypto into these homepage described file en and decoding program. In addition information to the program Krypto and several public keys files. Each sold Krypto software has its own registration. This registration and the program Krypto may not be passed on by them so easily or not changed. They may
not sell the program Krypto under the price offered here further. They must communicate this immediately to me, Detlef Granzow, since the registration must be rewritten then
with me. Therefore the buyer, who buys the software of them, must let be likewise registered with me, in order not to make itself punishable. Krypto may be used by you
only on your own maximally five computers. If they possess more than five computers on
you KRYPTO to use want, each further computer costs use per computer only 20 euro additionally. If the number of their computers is higher than five, you must the correct
number of their computers on those you KRYPTO to use want, me for the KRYPTO order correctly indicate. This applies even if you with KRYPTO on more than five their own computers by network works. With very large networks the price freely one negotiates. Because KRYPTO is to be used in principle also very well in networks. I, Detlef Granzow, arise in no case for damage to hard and software to computers or persons by the use
of the software Krypto and its program of parts belonging to it. An adhesion is
absolutely impossible. The software (Krypto 2.0/2006 Professional multi user) was tested extremely thoroughly on absolute correct function. Please you consider the law situation in their country, because not everywhere data are coding programs legally permitted.
In Europe and nearly everywhere in the world data are coding programs still legally permitted. With the purchase of the software Krypto they recognized these conditions.

Still something !
My homepage is not completely simple probably for some to understand, but complicated programs has also mostly complicated descriptions. Krypto was programmed however in such
a way by me, which can successfully use each healthy humans Krypto immediately after very
short time. From Krypto there is no demo or Shareware version. To the surface of Krypto I would like to communicate here also still something to program. The surface of Krypto is very zukunfts safe, thus means I, it in the future will like that be, of computers with gropes screens to be served and/or also with language. Therefore large switching surfaces
are not only meaningful for badly seeing humans absolutely. Furthermore the used Krypto surface is well removable. However also no problem the program surface of Krypto would be to be amended for me. If they click on these homepage completely down on 1.Download, they can down-load a small coded file, in order to regard exactly them. The file Download.kry is 18033 byte largely and with Krypto was provided. Everyone can try this file decode,
but believes it to me, it is unsuccessful wasted time. It will never give a technical possibility this file to decode correctly.
